To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to appeal the denial of coverage for the inpatient hospitalization to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital from 10/4/2017-10/10/2017, as stated in your letter dated [Date of Denial Letter]. I believe that the denial was unjustified and that the requested service is medically necessary for my child's well-being and future health.

First and foremost, I want to emphasize the critical condition of my 9-month-old son who has been diagnosed with a high-grade brain tumor. Following the diagnosis, he underwent surgical removal of the tumor at Stony Brook Hospital, where he received initial treatment. As part of his ongoing care, we made the decision to enroll him in a clinical trial at St. Jude's hospital, under the guidance of the principal investigator.

The principal investigator, who is an esteemed expert in the field, has specifically recommended a combination of medications including methotrexate, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vineristine, in conjunction with an investigational medication called alisertib. While it is acknowledged that this combination may deviate from the standard of care for this type of cancer, it is important to understand that alternative treatments are often pursued in cases where evidence-based guidelines are not yet established or available.

It is worth noting that St. Jude's hospital is renowned for its cutting-edge research and expertise in pediatric oncology. By participating in their clinical trial, my son not only receives access to potentially life-saving treatments but also contributes to the advancement of medical knowledge for the benefit of other children facing similar challenges.

Although you state that this combination of medications is considered experimental and investigational, I would like to highlight that medical advancements often stem from clinical trials and investigational treatments. Denying coverage solely on the grounds of lacking evidence-based guidelines fails to consider the potential benefits that may arise from innovative approaches. It is crucial to prioritize the best interests and well-being of patients in situations where standard treatments may not be sufficient or readily available.

In light of the above, I kindly request a thorough review of my son's case, taking into account the unique circumstances and the recommendations provided by the principal investigator at St. Jude's hospital. I believe that a reconsideration of this denial is warranted, as it directly affects the health and future prospects of my child.

To support this appeal, I have included the following additional supporting documentation, medical records, and expert opinions that further validate the medical necessity of the requested service. I kindly request that you reconsider your decision and provide the coverage for the inpatient hospitalization at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and your commitment to providing quality health care services. I trust that you will carefully review the information provided and make a fair and informed determination. If you require any additional information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address].


Sincerely,

[Your Name]
