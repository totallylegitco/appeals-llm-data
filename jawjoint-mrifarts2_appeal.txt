Subject: Appeal for Denial of Medically Necessary Services

Policy/Member Number: [Your Policy/Member Number]
Claim Number: [Claim Number]

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to appeal the denial of coverage for the requested services, as outlined in your letter dated [Date of Denial Letter]. I strongly believe that the services in question are medically necessary for my condition, and I respectfully request a reconsideration of your decision.

Firstly, I would like to clarify that my physician, [Physician's Name], who is familiar with my medical history, ordered the MRI of my lower back. The purpose of this diagnostic test was to assess any signs of nerve damage in my low back, including abnormal reflexes or muscle weakness in my leg. These symptoms have been causing me significant pain and discomfort, adversely impacting my daily activities and quality of life.

In your denial letter, you mentioned that the denial was not medically necessary due to the lack of medical records from my doctor. However, I want to bring to your attention that my physician did provide the necessary medical records supporting the medical necessity of the requested services. I kindly request that you review your records again to ensure that all relevant documentation has been taken into consideration.

Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that the decision to deny coverage was based on the AIM Specialty Health Guideline titled Imaging of the Spine. I have carefully reviewed this guideline at the provided web address, and I believe it supports the medical necessity of the requested services in my case. The guideline recognizes the importance of MRI imaging for diagnosing nerve damage in the lower back, which aligns with my physician's professional judgment.

I kindly request a copy of the documentation detailing how the decision to deny coverage was made. Understanding the specific reasons behind the denial will help me address any potential misunderstandings or discrepancies. I appreciate your assurance that this copy will be provided to me at no cost.

In light of the above information, I respectfully urge you to reconsider your decision and approve coverage for the requested services. I am confident that the medical records and the supporting AIM Specialty Health Guideline will demonstrate the medical necessity of the requested services and the importance of addressing my current health condition.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and fair reconsideration of my appeal. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address] if you require any additional information or if there are any further steps that I need to take to facilitate this process.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
