Dear [HealthInsurnaceCompany];

I received your recent notification regarding the denial of LIDOCAINE 5% PATCH 30/30. I’m writing to appeal this decision.

While you state that "The medication requested for the diagnosis provided is considered experimental/investigational and is excluded from the member’s benefit."

nHowever, LIDOCAINE 5% PATCH 30/30 has been successfully approved by the FDA and is routinely used to treat pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy.
In addition, several other large companies produce LIDOCAINE 5% PATCH 30/30 for the treatment of pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy.
Please review Überall MA, Bösl I, Hollanders E, Sabatschus I, Eerdekens M. Localized peripheral neuropathic pain: topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster in routine clinical practice. Pain Manag. Published online January 10, 2022. doi:10.2217/pmt-2021-0117

Sincerely,

[YOURNAME]
